# NFT Metadata Manager

## Overview

**NFT Metadata Manager** is a tool designed for NFT creators to simplify the process of uploading images and generating metadata for their NFT collections. This application utilizes [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) to store images and metadata on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), providing a decentralized and secure way to manage NFT assets. 

With this tool, users can:
- Upload artwork files (images) for NFTs.
- Add descriptions and properties to the NFTs.
- Generate metadata in JSON format, following standards like ERC-721 and ERC-1155.
- Preview how the NFT will look with the provided data.
- Obtain a direct link to the JSON metadata hosted on IPFS.
